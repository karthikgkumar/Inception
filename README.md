## Team Name
Inception

## Idea
Orma, a memory journal app for early-stage dementia, lets users save memories via a WhatsApp bot and prompts them with retrieval cues, while caregivers can track user details through a companion website. 
An example scenario would be <br/>

Store Memories: Simply tell Orma about your experiences with a sentence like "I went to Bangalore and saw my son." <br/>
Recall Memories: When you forget a detail, ask Orma "I went to Bangalore and met someone. Who was it?"<br/>
Relive Memories: Orma will remind you, "It was your son! You had a wonderful time together in Bangalore."<br/>

## Features 
1. Accessible WhatsApp Chatbot: Easy-to-use for seniors familiar with WhatsApp, minimizing the need to learn new interfaces.
2. Voice-Enabled Memories: Users can record memories and prompts using voice messages in any language, promoting engagement and simplifying interaction.
3. Comforting Companion: Uplifting messages and reminders to help users stay positive and motivated as they navigate memory challenges.
4. Preserving Precious Memories: Store important experiences and retrieve them later with simple prompts, empowering users to maintain a connection to their past.
5. Habit-Building Reminders: Timely prompts encourage consistent use, solidifying the app's role in memory preservation.
6. Progress Tracking (Caregiver/User): Monitor app usage patterns to understand user behavior and adapt support accordingly.
